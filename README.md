# Logic Parser for RetroAchievement

[RetroAchievement](https://retroachievements.org/) implements its achievement system through [RAIntegration](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAIntegration)   
It uses a string encoding to store the logic for an achievement.   
I highly recommend that you check the [RetroAchievement Dev Docs](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/) before using this parser.   


## How to Use
   
- `main.c` is only used for printing logic as readable data to the terminal. Unless that's what you want to do, do not add this file your project.   
   
- `achievement.h` is where the achievement `structs` and `enums` are stored. It is included by `parser.h` so you have to download it.
- `parser.h` and `parser.c` is where the main logic for the parsing resides.   
   
Add the following line to any C-based script to gain access to the parsing functions.
```c
#include "path/to/achievement.h"
```
Then you can use `get_achievement(char *achievement, size_t len)` to get the whole achievement parsed.   
It returns an object of type `struct ACHIEVEMENT *`   

##### Parsing Structure
   
- `NUMERAL` is a hand side of any comparison or operation, it has a type, a size, and a value.   
Since RAIntegration is a 32-bit DLL, the internal accumulator is 32-bit, so a numeral's value cannot go beyond that.   
```c
struct NUMERAL
{
  Type type;
  Size size;
  int32_t value;
};
```
   
- `CONDITION` represents any line of logic, with a left and right hand side. It can either represents a comparison or an operation.   
Each condition is indexed following a 1 based indexation   
```c
struct CONDITION
{
  int id;
  Flag flag;
  Operator op; // either an operator or a comparator, such as '=' or '+'
  int hit_target

  struct NUMERAL lhs;
  struct NUMERAL rhs;
}
```
   
- `GROUP` represents a set of `CONDITION`. Each achievement must have a Core group (represented here by a `GROUP` where `GROUP.id == 0`) and an arbitrary number of Alt Groups.
> Any achievement is unlocked when every condition in its Core Group AND in at least one Alt Group is true   
```c
struct GROUP
{
  int id;
  size_t condition_count;
  struct CONDITION *conditions[];
}
```
   
- `ACHIEVEMENT` represents a set of `GROUP`. It is the highest structure in the hierarchy. (Technically, an Achievement Set would be even higher, but it isn't currently supported by this parser.)
```c
struct ACHIEVEMENT
{
  int id;
  char *title;
  char *description;

  size_t group_count;
  struct GROUP *groups[];
}
```
